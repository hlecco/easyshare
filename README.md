# easyshare

Share your files with the world without other intermediaries.

## Setting up

Start the stack with `docker compose up`.

Then, visit `localhost:8384` and set up Synchting appropriately.
Shared folders created inside `syncthing/share` will be accessible
at `localhost:8080`.

## Sharing files

Once everything is set up, any files added to Syncthing shared folders
will be accessible.

Do not modify the directories contents directly, use other devices to do it.
